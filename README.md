# lee-dwmst
This is my configuration of suckless': dwm, st, dmenu, and slstatus. Initially this contained only dwm, but I didn't want to have to create and manage four repositories; and because these programs together form my window manager, it made sense for me to put them together.

## To-do List
### More streamlined workflow.
Currently I have to edit the source code, exit editor, compile program, test program, git add, git commit, git push. It's too much. I don't know git well enough yet to speed up pushing changes. I suppose a script, some aliasing, or a cronjob might be my solution. As for compiling, I might be able to compile through vim without exiting.
### Proper forking/branching of suckless programs
I know there is a better way to fork my own versions of programs through git. But I don't really have the time to figure that out right now.
